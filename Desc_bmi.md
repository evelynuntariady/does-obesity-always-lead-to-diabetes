Obesity is a medical condition characterized by excessive body fat accumulation that poses a risk to health. It is typically measured using the Body Mass Index (BMI), where a BMI of 30 or higher classifies an individual as obese.

This condition results from a complex interplay of genetic, behavioral, and environmental factors, including high caloric intake and low physical activity. Obesity significantly increases the risk of various health issues, such as cardiovascular diseases, **type 2 diabetes**, certain cancers, and musculoskeletal disorders.

## But does that mean **obesity = diabetes**?
