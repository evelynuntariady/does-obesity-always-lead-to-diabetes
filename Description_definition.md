## Diabetes

Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disease characterized by hyperglycemia (high levels of sugar in the blood). There are 3 types of diabetes, which are **type 1 diabetes**, **type 2 diabetes**, and **gestational diabetes**.

The cause of type 1 diabetes is deficiency of insulin secretion due to an autoimmune condition where the body's immune system attacks insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Insulin is a hormone that helps regulate blood glucose levels by facilitating the uptake of glucose into cells for energy production.

Type 2 diabetes is caused by a combination of resistance to insulin action and an inadequate insulin number. It is often associated with **obesity**, **physical inactivity**, and **genetics**. Type 2 diabetes can often be managed with lifestyle changes, oral medications, and sometimes insulin therapy.

The gestational diabetes occurs during *pregnancy* when the body cannot produce enough insulin to meet the increased needs, leading to high blood glucose levels. Gestational diabetes usually resolves after the baby is born, but it can increase the mother's risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life.



Diabetes often comes with a range of symptoms that can serve as early warning signs. Here are some **common symptoms** of diabetes :
1. *Increased Thirst and Frequent Urination*: High blood sugar levels cause excess glucose to accumulate in the urine, drawing water from the tissues and leading to dehydration.
2. *Extreme Hunger*: The body can't efficiently use glucose for energy, which can make you feel hungry even after eating.
3. *Unintended Weight Loss*: Despite eating more, you might lose weight as your body starts breaking down muscle and fat for energy.
4. *Slow-Healing Sores or Frequent Infections*: High glucose levels can impair the body's healing processes and immune response.
