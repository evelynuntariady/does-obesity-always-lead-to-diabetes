## Conclusion

The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), established by the United Nations, aim to address global challenges and ensure a better and more sustainable future for all. Goal 3, "Good Health and Well-being," is particularly relevant in the fight against *diabetes*, especially within high-risk populations like *Pima Indian women*. This goal focuses on ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for people of all ages, aiming to reduce premature mortality from non-communicable diseases like diabetes by one third by **2030** through prevention, treatment, and promotion of mental health and well-being.

For Pima Indian women, factors like genetics, lifestyle, and individual's age play significant roles in diabetes. While *obesity* is a **risk factor**, it's not the **sole determinant**. This understanding reshapes how we approach diabetes prevention and management.

Aligning with SDG 3, targeted interventions for Pima Indian women can significantly impact diabetes prevalence and management. Preventive measures, such as *community-based education programs* about healthy eating and the importance of physical activity, can help mitigate the risk factors associated with diabetes. *Early screening and regular health check-ups* are essential to identify those at risk and provide timely medical intervention. Moreover, *improving access to healthcare services* and diabetes management resources is vital to support those already living with the condition.

In essence, by synergizing efforts with SDG 3, we can make meaningful progress in reducing diabetes rates and promoting well-being. Together, we can create a future where everyone, regardless of background, can enjoy good health and vitality.
